Edge computing is a strategy for localized analysis of data, ahead in the pipeline of powerful data center- or cloud-based post-processing.\nThis course explores these aspects of IoT framework and expands it with edge computing ideology via practical and hands-on exposure. Students will be exposed to the IoT framework using a variety of sensors, IoT automation and connectivity in “microLabs” that incorporate the Raspberry Pi (single-board computer) and Python programming language.\nThe students will learn about how IoT with edge computing capability is going to be the backbone of the Industry 4.0.\n\n\n\nThis is a Quarto website.
